	These are brief questions to warm you up with a quick review of Feynman rules before starting the renormalization section. All these questions could be answered in less than one page by watching the uploaded video or referring to Schwartzâ€™s textbook.
	\section*{Problem 1: LSZ formula}
	
	\begin{problem}
		Express the LSZ formula and its implications. (No formula is needed; just a formal definition and its application and implications in QFT is enough.)
	\end{problem}

	\section*{Problem 2: Momentum Conservation in vertices}

\begin{problem}
	In a general vertex, show momentum conservation, or why $\delta^{(4)}(\sum p_{in} - \sum p_{out})$ appears in Feynman rules.
	
	\noindent
	More specifically, show that by integrating on the vertex position in the figure below, you'll end up with a Dirac delta, which guarantees the momentum conservation. Notice that you just need $e^{\pm ip.x}$ part of the propagator, regardless of its spin.

\end{problem}

\newpage
	\section*{Problem 3: Derivative coupling }

\begin{problem}
	Derive the Feynman rule of these two vertices in the figure 2. To be able to do so, I encourage you to look at the uploaded video.

\end{problem}

	\section*{Problem 4: Amplitudes}

\begin{problem}
	Write out the expressions for the amplitude of the following diagrams. The label below each one specifies the theory in which the amplitude should be written.
